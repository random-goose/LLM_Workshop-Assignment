Summary
The article discusses how AI powered chatbots provided wrong information to flight passengers and what that meant for the travellers.
It starts by giving an example of Air Canada’s chatbot which promised a discount that wasn’t available to passenger Jake Moffatt, who was assured that he could book a full-fare flight for his grandmother’s funeral and then apply for the bereavement fare. But this did not occur, and on complaining, the airline argued that the chatbot was a separate legal entity. But The British Columbia Civil Resolution Tribunal held the airline responsible and ruled in favour of Moffat who was compensated $812.02 (£642.64). Tribunal member Christopher River’s responded with his opinion against Air Canada as well. BBC travel got in contact with Gabor Lukacs, president of Air Passenger Rights shared that this case set precedent for airline and travel companies that are increasingly relying on AI and chatbots for customer interactions as it made it crystal clear that these companies will be liable for all information shared by such chatbots and cannot hide behind them. Previously in 2018, a WestJet chatbot sent a passenger a link to a suicide prevention hotline as a mistake. Such incidents are coined under the term "AI hallucination”. Thus the recent tribunal ruling has also alerted other industries like travel companies and businesses who heavily rely on AI along with airline companies. 
The article also discusses how air travellers can protect themselves by fact checking and not fully relying on chatbots information. Though it is not completely their responsibility, taking an extra step of precaution can save them from legal proceedings. Marisa Garcia, an aviation industry expert and senior contributor at Forbes shares that airlines have to refine their tools to ease workload on human staff and overtime the accuracy of such bots will improve. Erike Richter advised to consider old-fashioned human help with trip planning as chatbots cannot give the level of customer service required. Lukacs shared that regulations are different in different countries with Canada’s being weak and UK inheriting Civil Aviation Authority.  Lastly sharing that if a passenger is wronged, they should consider small claims court to get a fair trial.
